	* core.lua: Make the decision about which combat text to notify to at
	  addon load time rather than each time we loot, by generating a self.msg
	  closure.

	* Many files: Add support for fct, sct, and rename the addon

	* core.lua: Switch from using a local pattern for loot to modifying the
	  one from GlobalStrings.lua, to ensure that it works in all locales.

	* core.lua: Fix bug which resulted in MSBTLoot misreporting the current loot
	  count.  It was inadvertantly including the loot count of players other than
	  yourself in addition to your own.  The total count was always correct.

	* (Many files): Initial creation.
